test repo
learning to use git.

first you set up a repository that defaults with a master branch, then you can branch off of the main branch to make potential edits. You can choose to commit these edits to the main branch if wanted.


Now that we've set up a 'readme-edits' branch off of the master branch, we can freely make edits without compromising the master branch.
